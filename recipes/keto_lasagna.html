      <h4>KETO LASAGNA RECIPE</h4>  
      
       <P>Going Keto can be hard when you start thinking about what you'll be missing. Luckily, a classic lasagna won't be one of them. This low-carb lasagna uses a simple noodle replacement that once it's covered in meat and cheese, feels just like pasta.</P> 

      <h4>INGREDIENTS:</h4>  
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 jar (24 oz) sugar-free tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 container (15 oz) ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>8-10 large zucchini, sliced lengthwise into thin strips</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>STEPS:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef and onion together until the meat is no longer pink. Drain the excess fat.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, water, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Bring to a simmer and cook for 5-10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg and mix in the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Layer zucchini strips on top of the meat sauce, followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, and then a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Enjoy your delicious keto lasagna!</p>
